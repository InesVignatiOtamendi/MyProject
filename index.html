    <p>With the ratification of the federal statute of Buenos Aires on December 6, 1880, the so-called <em>capital of the Argentine Republic</em> issue was resolved, leaving behind a toll of 2,500 dead and wounded out of the 20,000 who had participated in the last and most violent chapter of the seventy-year dispute to define the seat of political authority.</p>
        
    <p>The battle for Buenos Aires was the end of a long confrontation between national and provincial governments, civilians and military, political parties, opposing figures, different sectors of economic power. But it was also, without a doubt, a struggle for a place, for a city, that would meet the material conditions necessary to house the federal government of a modern nation in evolution.</p>
        
    <p>It is important to remember that Buenos Aires was not always the capital of the Argentine State. The 1810 revolution brought about the separation from the Spanish Crown with the formation of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, and at the same time two conflicting models of the nation emerged: 
        
    <ol>
       <li> <strong>The unitarians (centralists):</strong> Who wanted a single nation under a central government located in Buenos Aires</li>
       <li> <strong>The federals (federalists):</strong> Who defended provincial autonomy. This schism provoked battles and conflicts that were only resolved in 1880. </li>
        
    </ol>
        During these seven decades, the city of Buenos Aires,  being the main commercial port of the region, established itself as the capital of the richest province  of Argentina, but only hosted the national government alternatively, provisionally, as a temporary guest. In practice, the asymmetric relationship between this predominant port city and the other provinces was always a cause of conflict.</p>

    <p>After independence from Spain in 1816, violence intensified. In 1820, the Province of Buenos Aires declared its autonomy and began to organize its own administration, initiating important territorial, urban and municipal transformations under the leadership of a distinguished group of politicians, businessmen and intellectuals. However, the outbreak of war with the Brazilian Empire in 1825 over the territory of the Banda Oriental (today Uruguay) provoked the need to demonstrate national unity. From the same political group that had declared autonomy for Buenos Aires emerged the first president of Argentina, <em id="semi">Bernardino Rivadavia</em>; during his seventeen months of government (1826-1827), he approved the first law for the demarcation of a national capital within a federal district.</p>
