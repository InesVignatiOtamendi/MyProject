    <h1>Provisional capital of Argentina</h1>

    <p>In 1862, the city of Buenos Aires was declared provisional capital for a period of five years, with the national government to provide whatever was needed, while public property would remain in the hands of the province. It was therefore established as a guest, until the stress of the situation exploded in 1880. In the meantime, President Bartolome Mitre stressed that it was necessary to fix the site of a capital.</p>
    
    <p>Uncertainty regarding the location of a fixed capital meant that no one would build public buildings, for fear of investing money in buildings that would have to be donated to the nation. The only permanent building that was built with a national purpose during these years was the Customs House in Buenos Aires. This project emerged from a competition that had drawn three proposals.</p>
    
    <p>The winning project was literally situated in the water of the RÃ­o de la Plata, to be precise, and it was known that the shores would always remain in the public domain, not private ones that did not belong to the provincial government. The building was a pioneer of its kind in South America. Designed and built in 1854 by an English engineer, the building was laid out on a semicircular plan and linked several levels of storage facing the river, with a dock for unloading and for passengers. On the side facing the city was a lighthouse tower, which for decades marked the cityscape of the waterfront.</p>
